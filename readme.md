# Cyber Pet Project
During my time on the Code Nation Master Bootcamp course, my teammates and I were tasked with create a virtual pet that can be interacted with via commandline.

## Intentions of this project
This project is meant to help teach how classes should be utilised in JavaScript and how to work as part of an effective team on a project.

### Requirements
To install the requirements of this project, first clone the repository to your computer and ensure that the *package.json* is present. If it is, open the directory in your terminal of choice and run ```npm install```
